RISC-V CPU & System software implementation written in –°

## What's working
[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Check%20it%20out-WASM%20Demo-red?style=for-the-badge)](https://lekkit.github.io/test/index.html)
- Passes RISC-V compliance/torture tests for both RV64 & RV32
- OpenSBI, U-Boot, custom firmwares boot and execute properly
- Working Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Haiku & other cool OSes
- Tracing JIT, multicore support
- Framebuffer display, mouse & keyboard, UART shell
- NVMe storage drives
- Networking

## üí° Tell me more...
- Feature-complete RV64IMAFDC instruction set
- Multicore support (SMP), SV32/SV39/SV48/SV57 MMU
- Tracing RVJIT with x86_64, ARM64, RISC-V, i386, ARM backends
  (faster than QEMU, yay!)
- Bootrom, Kernel Image loading, ELF support
- Device Tree auto-generation, passing to firmware/kernel
- RVVM Public API for VM integration
- UART 16550a-compatible text console
- PLIC/ACLINT, Timers, Poweroff/reset
- Generic PCI Express Bus
- NVMe storage, image TRIM support, fast IO
- Framebuffer display, GUI for X11/WinAPI/Haiku/SDL
- I2C HID keyboard & mouse, OpenCores I2C controller
- Realtek RTL8169, OpenCores Ethernet NICs
- Userspace networking
- VFIO PCI Passthrough (For GPUs, etc)
- SiFive GPIO
- Deprecated: PS2 keyboard & mouse, ATA (IDE) drive, Linux TAP

## üì¶ Installing
[![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/BIN-Release-green?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/LekKit/RVVM/releases) 
[![Artifacts](https://img.shields.io/badge/BIN-Artifacts-orange?style=for-the-badge)](https://nightly.link/LekKit/RVVM/workflows/build/staging) [![AUR](https://img.shields.io/badge/Arch%20Linux-AUR-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=archlinux)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rvvm-git) [![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/Build-Make-red?style=for-the-badge)](#-building)

## üõ† Building
Currently builds using GNU Make (recommended) or CMake and is extremely portable.
```
git clone https://github.com/LekKit/RVVM
cd RVVM
make
cd release.linux.x86_64
./rvvm_x86_64 -h
```
You can configure the build with USE flags. To cross-compile, pass CC=target-gcc to make. If it fails to detect features, pass ARCH/OS variables explicitly.

Examples:
```
make lib CC=aarch64-linux-android21-clang USE_FB=0
make lib all CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc USE_NET=1
make CFLAGS=-m32 ARCH=i386 USE_RV64=0 BUILDDIR=build BINARY=rvvm
make CC=mipseb-linux-gnu-gcc USE_JIT=0 USE_SDL=2
```
Alternatively, you can use CMake:
```
git clone https://github.com/LekKit/RVVM
cd RVVM
cmake -S. -Bbuild
cmake --build build --target all
cd build
./rvvm -h
```

## üöÄ Running
```
rvvm fw_payload.bin -i drive.img -m 2G -smp 2 -res 1280x720
```
Recommended working firmware, distro images are found in [Release section](https://github.com/LekKit/RVVM/releases/tag/v0.6)

Argument explanation:
```
[fw_payload.bin]       Initial M-mode firmware, OpenSBI + U-Boot in this case
-k, -kernel u-boot.bin Optional S-mode kernel payload (Linux Image, U-Boot, etc)
-i, -image drive.img   Attach storage image (Raw format, NVMe as of now)
-m, -mem 2G            Memory amount (may be suffixed by k/M/G), default 256M
-s, -smp 2             Amount of cores, single-core machine by default
-res 1280x720          Changes framebuffer & VM window resolution
-rv32                  Enable 32-bit RISC-V, 64-bit by default
 . . .
-cmdline, -append ...  Override/append default kernel command line
-nogui, -nojit         Disable GUI (Use only UART), Disable JIT (for debugging)
-v                     Verbose mode
```
Invoke `rvvm -h` to see extended help.

## üîç TODO
- Implement Sstimecmp, Svpbmt, Svnapot extensions
- Sparse block image format with compression/deduplication
- Suspend/resume to file, VM migration
- Linux userspace binary emulation (WIP)
- Sound (HD Audio or else)
- More RVJIT optimizations, shared caches
- FPU JIT (Complicated AF to make a conformant one)
- Vector extensions
- Other peripherals from real boards (VisionFive 2: GPIO, SPI, flash...)
- RISC-V APLIC, PCIe MSI Interrupts
- *Maybe* virtio devices (For better QEMU interoperability, current devices are plenty fast)
- Free page reporting via virtio-balloon
- *A lot more...*
- KVM hypervisor? Alternative CPU engines?
